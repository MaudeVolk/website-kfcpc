First Cumberland is part of a small denomination known as the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, which was formed in 1810. We differ from other Presbyterian denominations in that we adhere to a "whosoever will" gospel, instead of the Doctrin of Election (predestination).^p

A church means many different things to people. Some see it as a building. Others see it only as an organization. To some it is a series of special programs. In simplest terms, First Cumberland is people - we are a people with a special relationship. That relationship is not with a building, an organization, a program, or even a denomination; it is to a Person, and that Person is Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. Because of our relationship with Christ, we have a special family relationship with each other.^p
