Welcome to the Knoxville First Cumberland Presbyterian Church website. We are glad you have chosen to spend a few moments looking around,
discovering our church family. When we describe First Cumberland to people, We use words like ‘community’ and ‘family.’^p

We are a group of people committed to following the risen Jesus. That means we worship Him with vigor and joy.
That means we encourage prayer in church and throughout life. That means we love people outside the church through generosity,
invitation, and compassion.^p

Our hope is that all people will feel loved and welcomed at First Cumberland. And once here,
we pray that people will meet God and as a result of meeting God, give their lives to Jesus Christ. We want that for you.
Come as you are. Check us out, but more importantly, seek the truth of God that can only be known when one knows Jesus.^p

While you are browsing our website, you will learn about our programs and get a glimpse of who we are, but only a glimpse.
To fully understand us, come to a worship service or to a small group and feel the up-close, in-person fellowship that comes
when people share time together with the Holy Spirit present. Enjoy the website, then come. We would love to meet you and know you.
